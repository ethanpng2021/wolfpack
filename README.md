# Wolf-Pack Hunting with Special Relativity: An Alternative to Transformers' Training

Modern deep learning is dominated by **gradient-based optimizers** like Adam and SGD.  
But what if we could train neural networks *without* relying on gradients at all?  

In this tutorial, we’ll explore a hybrid **metaheuristic optimizer** inspired by **wolf-pack hunting** and **special relativity**.  
It’s not meant to replace Transformers at scale, but it offers a fascinating look at how *physics* and *nature* can inspire new ways to train models.

## Part 1: The Wolf-Pack Hunting Algorithm

The wolf-pack metaphor comes from how wolves coordinate in nature:
- **Alpha, Beta, Delta wolves**: the best-performing solutions guide the rest of the pack.
- **Scouting**: some wolves explore randomly to avoid stagnation.
- **Besieging**: weak wolves are reinitialized near leaders to refocus the search.

Mathematically, each solution (a “wolf”) is a vector of neural network weights.  
The update rule nudges wolves toward leaders while still keeping randomness:

$$
\mathbf{v}_{t+1} = \omega \mathbf{v}_t + c_1 r_1 (\alpha - x) + c_2 r_2 (\beta - x) + c_3 r_3 (\delta - x)
$$

where:
- $x$ = wolf position (weights)  
- $\mathbf{v}$ = velocity  
- $\alpha, \beta, \delta$ = leader wolves  
- $\omega, c_1, c_2, c_3$ = coefficients  
- $r_1, r_2, r_3$ = random factors

## Part 2: Special Relativity in Optimization

We add a physics-inspired twist: **no wolf can move faster than light speed \(c\)**.

1. **Speed Limit**  
   If a wolf’s velocity norm $\|\mathbf{v}\|$ exceeds $c$, we rescale it:

   $$\mathbf{v} \leftarrow \frac{c \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}$$

2. **Lorentz Factor (γ)**  
   In relativity, time dilates as objects approach light speed.  
   We use this to **shrink step sizes** for very fast wolves:

   $$\Delta x = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\gamma}, \quad$$ 
   $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (\|\mathbf{v}\|/c)^2}}$$

   → Fast wolves “slow down,” preventing chaotic jumps.

This creates a natural **adaptive learning rate** — no manual tuning needed.

## Strengths of This Approach

- **Gradient-free**: Works even if gradients are noisy or undefined.  
- **Global exploration**: Reduces risk of bad local minima.  
- **Stability**: Relativistic scaling prevents runaway updates.  
- **Hybrid potential**: Can initialize weights globally, then refine with backpropagation.

## Example: Training a Tiny Sentiment Classifier

We’ll use a bag-of-words model on a small dataset of positive/negative sentences.

### Step 1: Dataset
```python
sentences = [
    "I love this movie",
    "This film is great",
    "What a fantastic experience",
    "I really enjoyed the show",
    "Amazing performance and story",
    "I hate this movie",
    "This film is terrible",
    "What a boring experience",
    "I really disliked the show",
    "Awful performance and story"
]
labels = [[1],[1],[1],[1],[1],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0]]
